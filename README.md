[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/scholarly/badge/?version=latest)](https://scholarly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

scholarly scrapes [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) in a friendly, Pythonic way. You can use it to collect information about papers and authors.

Please see [the documentation](https://scholarly.readthedocs.io) for Usage information


## Usage
Because `scholarly` does not use an official API, no key is required. Simply:

```python
from scholarly import get_scholarly_instance

scholarly = get_scholarly_instance()
print(next(scholarly.search_author('Steven A. Cholewiak')))
```

### Methods
* `search_author` -- Search for an author by name and return a generator of Author objects.

```python
>>> scholarly = get_scholarly_instance()
>>> search_query = scholarly.search_author('Marty Banks, Berkeley')
>>> print(next(search_query))
{'_filled': False,
 'affiliation': 'Professor of Vision Science, UC Berkeley',
 'citedby': 17758,
 'email': '@berkeley.edu',
 'id': 'Smr99uEAAAAJ',
 'interests': ['vision science', 'psychology', 'human factors', 'neuroscience'],
 'name': 'Martin Banks',
 'url_picture': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=Smr99uEAAAAJ'}
```

* `search_keyword` -- Search by keyword and return a generator of Author objects.

```python
>>> scholarly = get_scholarly_instance()
>>> search_query = scholarly.search_keyword('Haptics')
>>> print(next(search_query))
{'_filled': False,
 'affiliation': 'Stanford University',
 'citedby': 31731,
 'email': '@cs.stanford.edu',
 'id': '4arkOLcAAAAJ',
 'interests': ['Robotics', 'Haptics', 'Human Motion Understanding'],
 'name': 'Oussama Khatib',
 'url_picture': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=4arkOLcAAAAJ'}
```

* `search_pubs_query` -- Search for articles/publications and return generator of Publication objects.

```python
>>> scholarly = get_scholarly_instance()
>>> search_query = scholarly.search_pubs_query('Perception of physical stability and center of mass of 3D objects')
>>> print(next(search_query))
{'_filled': False,
 'bib': {'abstract': 'Humans can judge from vision alone whether an object is '
                     'physically stable or not. Such judgments allow observers '
                     'to predict the physical behavior of objects, and hence '
                     'to guide their motor actions. We investigated the visual '
                     'estimation of physical stability of 3-D objects (shown '
                     'in stereoscopically viewed rendered scenes) and how it '
                     'relates to visual estimates of their center of mass '
                     '(COM). In Experiment 1, observers viewed an object near '
                     'the edge of a table and adjusted its tilt to the '
                     'perceived critical angle, ie, the tilt angle at which '
                     'the object â€¦',
         'author': 'SA Cholewiak and RW Fleming and M Singh',
         'eprint': 'http://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2213254',
         'title': 'Perception of physical stability and center of mass of 3-D '
                  'objects',

 'citedby': 14,

```


### Example
Here's a quick example demonstrating how to retrieve an author's profile then retrieve the titles of the papers that cite his most popular (cited) paper.

```python
# Retrieve the author's data, fill-in, and print
scholarly = get_scholarly_instance()
search_query = scholarly.search_author('Steven A Cholewiak')
author = next(search_query).fill()
print(author)

# Print the titles of the author's publications
print([pub.bib['title'] for pub in author.publications])

# Take a closer look at the first publication
pub = author.publications[0].fill()
print(pub)

# Which papers cited that publication?
print([citation.bib['title'] for citation in pub.get_citedby()])
```

### Using a proxy
Just run `get_scholarly_instance(use_proxy = True)`. You will obtain a scholarly instance that uses a proxy.
*Note: this is a completely optional - opt-in feature'

```python
    >>> scholarly = get_scholarly_instance(use_proxy = True)
    >>> # If proxy is correctly set up, the following runs through it
    >>> scholarly.search_author('Steven A Cholewiak')
    >>>

```

### Using selenium
Just run `get_scholarly_instance(use_selenium = True)`. You will obtain a scholarly instance that uses selenium instead of `requests` for web requests. This can be used to manually input captchas if asked for by Google Scholar.
*Note: this is a completely optional - opt-in feature'

```python
    >>> scholarly = get_scholarly_instance(use_selenium = True)
    >>> # You will see a remote controled firefox window
    >>> scholarly.search_author('Steven A Cholewiak')
    >>>

```
